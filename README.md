# Rust From TypeScript

Hey folks! Tyler here. Like many web developers, intrigued by the immense popularity of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)-based tools nowadays, I recently decided to try my hand at finally learning the language. 

However, as more of a visual learner myself, thought it might be easier to understand Rust if I rooted it in what I already know: TypeScript. There's [already an in-progress, paid course](https://rustforjs.dev/) for learning Rust if you have a JavaScript background, but being the impatient person that I am, thought it would be better if I just wrote up my own learnings and posted them here instead.

This repository is a work in progress and is being written as I navigate the [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) e-book and conduct my own research. Hope it helps you as much as it is helping me.

**This book assumes you already know TypeScript (or JavaScript) decently well.**
