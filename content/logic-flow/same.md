# What Stays The Same

Not everything in Rust is different, especially when it comes to logic flows. The following keywords function pretty much the same as TypeScript and aren't worth getting into here:
- [`if`/`else`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/if_else.html)
- [`while`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/while.html)
